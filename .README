## About Our App
With the growing trend in technologies from AR, VR to AI, ML to Blockchain, human beings are progressing
faster than ever but at what cost? Humanity! 
Even after educating the society for years still Women in our society faces troubles while they are travelling alone, 
they are not safe even at their own houses. Our aim as a Computer Science Engineering students

the minds of the people but atleast we can try saving women thereby, making a safe place for them to live and
fulfill their dreams.
